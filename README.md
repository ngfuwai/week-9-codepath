Week 9 codepath

I followed all of the instructions for Assignment Week 9, and I used only honeypot1. I encountered a gateway issue when trying to access the MHN server. However, restarting the machine was able to resolve that issue. I used my Kali VM to nmap the honeypot vm, but I cannot get any attacks on my MHN server to display.
